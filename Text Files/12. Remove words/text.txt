Attitudes to sacred texts differ. Some religions make written texts widely and freely available, 
while others hold that sacred secrets must remain hidden from all but the loyal and the initiate. 
Most religions promulgate policies defining the limits of the sacred texts and controlling or 
forbidding changes and additions. Some religions view their sacred texts as the "Word of God", 
often contending that the texts are inspired by God and as such not open to alteration. 
Translations of texts may receive official blessing, but an original sacred language often has 
de facto, absolute or exclusive paramountcy. Some religions make texts available free or in 
subsidized form; others require payment and the strict observance of copyright.
